				<h1>My story</h1>
				<p>
					Hello, Iâ€™m Dmitry. I am a junior front-end developer from Russia. I
					started my journey in 2023, when I decided to change my life. I have
					always been interested in working with computers and learning new
					programs. Developing new products with my own hands, understanding
					programming languages, writing code and mastering new technologies is
					a fascinating process for me.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the moment, I am self-studying all the material on front-end
					development. Services like
					<a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a>
					and
					<a
						href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript"
						target="_blank"
						>The Odin Project</a
					>
					are very helpful to me. I have already mastered several web
					technologies and have several projects on GitHub, each of which is a
					consolidation of new knowledge for me.
				</p>
				<p>
					I really enjoy programming and I am happy to learn something new and
					improve my code every day. I clearly see my way forward - after
					front-end, I want to apply my skills in back-end, to become a
					full-stack developer. I know what technologies I have to master, and
					this motivates me.
				</p>
				<p>
					To become better, I spend as much time as possible on developing my
					web skills and English language. In addition, I have a hobby related
					to computers - I have a home server Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi OS,
					on which I additionally practice my skills in working with Linux.
